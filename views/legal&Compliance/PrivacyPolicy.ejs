      in tracking and displaying students' performance, facilitating communication
      between teachers, parents, and school administrators. We are committed to
      protecting the privacy of our users and have created this Privacy Policy to

      school. Student Performance Data: OnePlace allows teachers to input and
      display students' performance in various tests. This data is associated with
      individual students and may include scores, grades, and other academic
      metrics. Usage Data: We may collect information about how OnePlace is
      accessed and used. This may include IP addresses, browser types, access

      Data Sharing and Disclosure With Schools and Teachers: Student performance
      data is shared with the respective teachers and school administrators who
      have access to the platform. Parents may also view their child’s performance
      as authorized by the school. With Parents: Schools may authorize parents to
      view their child’s performance data through OnePlace. Parents will only have
      access to information specific to their child. Third-Party Service
      Providers: We may share information with third-party service providers who
      assist us in operating OnePlace or conducting our business. These providers
      are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of
      the data. Legal Requirements: We may disclose your information if required
      by law or in response to a valid request by public authorities.

      5. Data Security We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the
      safety of your personal information. These include encryption, secure
      servers, and restricted access to sensitive data. However, no method of
      transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is completely secure,
      and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Data Retention We will retain your personal information and student
      performance data for as long as your school’s account is active or as needed
      to provide the services. If a school decides to terminate its use of
      OnePlace, we will delete or anonymize personal information as required by
      applicable laws.
    </p>
    <p>

      the right to access and correct any personal information we hold. Requests
      for access or corrections should be directed to the school administrator.

      such requests in accordance with applicable laws.
